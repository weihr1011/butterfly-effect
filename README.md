# butterfly-effect
This program investigates the so-called “butterfly effect”, in which a small deviation in the initial conditions of a non-linear dynamical system diverges over time, until the states of the original and perturbed systems are completely different. A corollary is that non-linear dynamical systems eventually become unpredictable, given that it is never possible to measure the initial state to infinite precision
